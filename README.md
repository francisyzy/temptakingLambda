# temptakingLambda

Shoutout to the base code generated from [Postman](https://go.pstmn.io/generic-codegen-repo)! Great starting point for me to copy paste code from.

Anyways this repo is just for me to ref in the future if I ever want to work with AWS Lambda ever again.

Note that the project will work to dump the data onto [Post Test Server V2](http://ptsv2.com/s/whatisthis.html). Get your own Bearer token from your website you want to POST into.
